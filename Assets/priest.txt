Our crawdad which art in ocean
<wait 5>
Shallowed be thy name
<wait 5>
Thy sea floor come
<wait 5>
Thy swells be done
<wait 5>
On land as it is in ocean
<wait 5>
Give us this day our daily krill
<wait 5>
And forgive us our wake
<wait 5>
As we forgive our wakers
<wait 5>
Lead us not into anglerfish
<wait 5>
But deliver us from nets
<wait 5>
For thine is the sea floor
<wait 5>
The trenches
<wait 5>
And the  current
<wait 5>
Amen.
